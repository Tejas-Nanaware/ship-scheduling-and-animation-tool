# ship-scheduling-and-animation-tool

There are many research project ships that lie in the mid-sea for a long long time!
So those equipments can be used by other small projects.

It provides clear visual representation of the ships along with its path.

The main advantage of this project is that it helps in elimination of the conflicts between the ships by displaying path for each ship and the duration of the project.
This enables us to optimize the scheduling process so that operations can be carried out without any delay.
Thus saving a lot of time and money.
